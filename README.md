# ABS Challenge Engine

A decision-support tool for optimizing ball-strike challenge decisions under MLB's Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) system. Built for front office analysts, coaching staffs, and player development.

**[Live App →](https://abs-challenge.vercel.app/)**

## What It Does

Under ABS, players have roughly two seconds to decide whether to challenge an umpire's call — with no outside help. This tool quantifies that decision using count-level run expectancy and [Tom Tango's break-even confidence thresholds](https://tangotiger.com/index.php/site/article/cost-benefit-analysis-of-making-an-abs-challenge).

The core model:

```
benefit = |ΔRE| of flipping the call
cost    = ~0.20 runs (empirical, from 2025 AAA challenge data)

Break-even = cost / (benefit + cost)
CHALLENGE when your confidence ≥ break-even
```

Thresholds range from **10%** (bases loaded, 2 outs, full count — challenge on a hunch) to **88%** (bases empty, 0 outs, 0-2 count — hold unless certain).

## Why Inning & Score Don't Matter

Per [Tango's cost/benefit analysis](https://tangotiger.com/index.php/site/article/cost-benefit-analysis-of-making-an-abs-challenge), the average value of an overturned call is ~0.20 runs — and this holds remarkably flat across innings and challenge inventory (1 vs 2 remaining). Because the cost stays constant, leverage index scales both sides of the equation equally and cancels out. The challenge decision reduces to: how big is the ΔRE of this specific count flip relative to the fixed ~0.20 run cost?

## Features

**Simulator** — Set count, outs, base runners, and perspective (batting/pitching). See the break-even confidence threshold, run expectancy, and challenge recommendation for every valid transition. Includes a "Two inputs, one decision" explainer showing how break-even (from game state) and zone confidence (from pitch location) combine to drive the challenge/hold decision.

**Training Mode** — Timed flashcard drills that test challenge decisions under pressure. Each round presents a game state and pitch location, gives you 2 seconds to decide challenge or accept, then reveals a tiered verdict based on both zone confidence and break-even math.

- **Six verdict tiers**: 🎯 Perfect, 🧊 Disciplined hold, 👁 Smart but costly, 🤏 Tough hold, ⚠ Missed opportunity, ✗ Bad challenge — each with a plain-English explanation of what happened and why.
- **Three difficulty levels**: Level 1 (obvious calls, extreme game states), Level 2 (mid-range thresholds, the shadow zone), Level 3 (edge cases, borderline pitches near the effective zone boundary). Corner pitches — near two edges simultaneously — appear at levels 2–3.
- **Challenge budget modes**: Unlimited (practice), 2 challenges (MLB rules), or 1 challenge (hard mode). Incorrect challenges cost inventory; correct challenges are free. Round ends when you're out. Summary includes a budget narrative contrasting your worst wasted challenge against your biggest missed opportunity.
- **Historical games**: A selectable library of real Statcast pitch data from famous games. Includes 2025 World Series Game 7, 2024 AL Wild Card Game 3, Angel Hernandez's worst game, and Domingo Germán's perfect game. Each pitch has real coordinates, batter/pitcher names, pitch type and speed, and contextual notes explaining why the pitch mattered.
- **Adaptive difficulty**: Tracks rolling accuracy over the last 5 cards. At 80%+ perfect rate, pitch offsets tighten (down to 0.3× at 100%). At level 3 with adaptation active, 60% of game states are drawn from a coin-flip pool where break-even is 36–60% — the true toss-up decisions where zone confidence and break-even converge.
- **Tug of war on reveal**: After every pitch, the reveal card shows both sides of the overturn — "Overturn strike" vs "Overturn ball" — with run swings and a proportional bar showing who has more to gain. Teaches that every challenge is asymmetric between batter and catcher.
- **Break-even intuition**: A one-sentence explanation on every reveal card connecting the game state to the break-even in plain English. "Loaded, 2 out — overturning this walk scores a run. The swing is huge, so even a small read justifies the challenge."
- **RE decision ledger**: Running total of run expectancy lost to suboptimal decisions. 0.000 is perfect — every mistake shows a negative cost vs the optimal action. Displayed per-card on reveal and as the summary headline.
- **Replay reel**: Summary screen opens with a horizontal strip of mini zone graphics for every pitch in the round, color-coded by verdict with emoji badges and zone confidence. Spot patterns at a glance — "all my mistakes were high pitches" or "I kept biting on the inside corner."

**Signal Mode** — Visual green/red/yellow indicator showing whether to challenge based on zone confidence vs. break-even threshold for the current game state. Designed for training catchers and batters to internalize challenge decisions before game situations.

**Live Game Mode** — Connects to the MLB Stats API and polls the linescore every 5 seconds during live games. Auto-populates count, outs, runners, inning, and score with team abbreviations. On game selection, preloads season xwOBA for both rosters via a [Vercel serverless endpoint](#xwoba-api) and computes a **matchup multiplier** for each at-bat that adjusts ΔRE based on the current batter-pitcher pairing relative to league average.

**Trackman Integration** — Accepts pitch location data via CSV upload, coordinate paste, or websocket connection. Supports Trackman V3 native field names (`PlateLocSide`, `PlateLocHeight`, `PitchCall`), Statcast aliases (`plate_x`, `plate_z`), and shorthand — case-insensitive, first match wins. Zone confidence is calculated automatically using a Gaussian model (σ=1.0") based on pitch distance from the zone edge.

**World Series Game 7 Demo** — Walk through 8 pivotal at-bats from the LAD-TOR Game 7 with real 2025 Statcast xwOBA data, showing how challenge decisions would have played out under ABS.

**Terminal Transitions** — Models strikeouts and walks as full base-out state changes, not just count changes. Overturning a ball on an x-2 count produces a strikeout (outs +1, runners stay). Overturning a strike on a 3-x count produces a walk (batter to 1st, forced runners advance, bases-loaded walk scores a run).

**RE288 Matrix** — Interactive heatmap of all 288 run expectancy states (12 counts × 8 base states × 3 out states) with three views:
- **Run Expectancy** — Absolute expected runs from each state through end of half-inning
- **Run Values** — Marginal runs relative to the 0-0 count in each base-out state ([Tango's "second chart"](https://tangotiger.com/index.php/site/comments/re288-run-expectancy-by-the-24-base-out-states-x-12-plate-count-states-recu))
- **Count Δ** — RE shift when a ball is overturned to a strike, including terminal strikeout deltas for x-2 counts

**Threshold Matrix** — Full heatmap of Tango's break-even confidence thresholds across all count × base-out states. Blue = low bar (challenge-friendly), red = high bar (hold unless certain).

**Methodology** — Full documentation of the decision framework, data sources, Tango's cost/benefit analysis, matchup adjustment math, and known limitations.

## The Model

| Factor | Description |
|---|---|
| **ΔRE** | Run expectancy difference between the called count and corrected count, including terminal K/BB state changes |
| **Challenge Cost** | ~0.20 runs — empirical average from 2025 AAA data, flat across innings and inventory ([Tango, Feb 2025](https://tangotiger.com/index.php/site/article/cost-benefit-analysis-of-making-an-abs-challenge)) |
| **Matchup Multiplier** | xwOBA-based scaling of ΔRE for the current batter-pitcher pairing vs. league average (live and demo modes) |
| **Zone Confidence** | Gaussian probability estimate based on pitch distance from zone edge (σ=1.0"), computed from Trackman or Statcast pitch coordinates |

```
batterFactor  = batterXwOBA / leagueXwOBA
pitcherFactor = pitcherXwOBA_against / leagueXwOBA
matchupMultiplier = batterFactor × pitcherFactor    (clamped to [0.5, 2.0])
adjustedΔRE = ΔRE × matchupMultiplier

Break-even = 0.20 / (|adjustedΔRE| + 0.20)
```

A league-average matchup produces a multiplier of ~1.0×. An elite hitter facing a weak pitcher pushes ×1.3+, lowering the break-even threshold. A weak hitter vs. an ace compresses ΔRE, raising the bar.

## Zone Model

Zone confidence is calculated automatically from pitch location data:

```
zoneWidth  = (17 + 2.9) / 12    // plate width + ball diameter, in feet
distance   = pitch distance from nearest zone edge
confidence = Φ(distance / σ)     // σ = 1.0 inch
```

Strike zone boundaries use `sz_top` and `sz_bot` from Statcast when available, or configurable defaults (3.5 / 1.6 ft) for Trackman data where per-batter zone heights are not included in the CSV.

## xwOBA API

The app includes a Vercel serverless function (`/api/xwoba`) that fetches season xwOBA data from Baseball Savant for all qualified batters and pitchers:

- Fetches batter + pitcher CSVs from `baseballsavant.mlb.com` in parallel
- Parses and returns JSON: `{ season, updated, lg_xwoba, players: { [id]: { name, xwoba, pa, type } } }`
- In-memory cache with 12-hour TTL; serves stale cache if Savant is down
- Falls back to a statsapi OPS→xwOBA conversion formula for players missing from Savant data

### Known Limitations

- xwOBA uses full-season Statcast data — doesn't capture platoon splits, recent form, or pitch-type matchup edges
- Trackman V3 CSVs do not include per-batter strike zone heights or umpire identity — these must be added manually or configured in the UI
- Zone confidence model assumes Gaussian error distribution; real tracking system accuracy may vary

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sdm-commits/abs-challenge-engine.git
cd abs-challenge-engine
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` to run locally. Live game mode and the xwOBA API work in local dev via Vite's proxy.

## Deploy

Connect this repo to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) — it auto-detects Vite and deploys with zero configuration. The `/api/xwoba` serverless function deploys automatically.

```bash
npm run build
